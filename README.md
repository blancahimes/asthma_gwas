asthma_gwas
===========

tab-delimited txt files of asthma and related phenotype GWAS results that are publicly available. The files are simplified from Tables and Supplements that were in PDF or Word documents. The GWAS manuscripts chosen were those based on the greatest number of subjects/cohorts. 

1. Bronchodilator response GWAS results from [<i>Himes et al </i> (2012)](http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1002824)

  * Main results (BDR_GWAS_main.txt): Based on genotyped results from four cohorts (CLLS) and imputed results from two cohorts (CARE and ACRN). Replication results are from a fifth cohort (SARP). 
  * Imputed results (BDR_GWAS_imputed.txt): Analogous to above, but imputed results for all cohorts used to compute overall p-values. Some SNPs overlap with those from the main results file, but replication data was requested based on the main results list.
